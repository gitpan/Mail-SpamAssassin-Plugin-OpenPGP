Wow.. it's almost thursday already.  Sorry I didn't get this out sooner.

I have two tests tomorrow, plus a senior project meeting during chapel
break so I can't come to a meeting.  If folks want to meet, discussion
of the website content management systems that Andy M emailed about
earlier would be good.

Regarding SIGs, I have the feeling that we need some more
interest/momentum/whatever.  I don't know how to spark this, perhaps you
guys have some ideas.

We will have a meeting after spring break.
