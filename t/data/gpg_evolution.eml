Hello -

I have been trying to integrate acegi security (w/ Spring) and JSF as
described on the myfaces wiki page:

http://wiki.apache.org/myfaces/JSF_and_Acegi

The error I get is from tomcat is: "The requested resource
(/pmmWeb/j_acegi_security_check.html) is not available." where pmmWeb is
the web application context.

I do have /j_acegi_security_check.jsp in the faces-config.xml file and
in the application context file for acegi. =20

This application uses facelets as well.

Has anyone used the process described on the wiki page successfully with
facelets?

Thanks,

Brad Smith
